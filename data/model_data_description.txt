DESCRIPTION:
This dataset contains weekly aggregated weather information derived from two NOAA weather stations in Massachusetts:
- Boston Logan International Airport, MA US
- Jamaica Plain, MA US

The data is structured for supervised machine learning models with the goal of predicting weekly precipitation using historical weather patterns and seasonal context.

COLUMNS:

1. Season_Code         → Encoded meteorological season:
                           0 = Winter, 1 = Spring, 2 = Summer, 3 = Fall
2. WEEK                → Start date of the week (YYYY-MM-DD)
3. Avg_Temp_t-2        → Average temperature 2 weeks prior
4. Avg_Temp_t-1        → Average temperature 1 week prior
5. Avg_Temp            → Average temperature of the current week
6. Avg_Precip_t-2      → Average precipitation 2 weeks prior (mean of both stations)
7. Avg_Precip_t-1      → Average precipitation 1 week prior
8. Target_Precip_t     → Target variable: average precipitation for the current week

PREPROCESSING PIPELINE:

1. Daily data loaded and cleaned. Missing TAVG values were filled using (TMAX + TMIN)/2.
2. Data from both stations was merged per day, showing both stations' values side-by-side.
3. Daily averages were computed across the two stations.
4. Aggregated to weekly granularity (Monday to Sunday).
5. Generated lag features for 1 and 2 weeks prior (t-1, t-2) for both temperature and precipitation.
6. Mapped each week's start date to its meteorological season and encoded it numerically.
7. Final DataFrame was structured to suit supervised learning models.

NOTES:

- The dataset is ideal for models like Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, or other temporal prediction techniques.
- Granularity is weekly to balance temporal resolution with noise reduction.
- Consider normalization or scaling if required by the model.
